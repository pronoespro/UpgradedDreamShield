# Upgraded_Dream_Shield

A mod for the game Hollow Knight that changes how Dream Shield works.

Now it will aim the way you're moving, or up/down if you're pressing W/S; it can also shoot a big, low damage projectile with a 1 second cooldown when you slash with your nail (during cooldown, the size of the shield is severelly decreased).
